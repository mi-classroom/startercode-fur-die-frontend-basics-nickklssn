    <h1>Design Principles</h1>
    <hr>
    <p class="chapter-intro">The challenge is to develop an application that tries to increase the user’s participation
        in team sports through
        online communities. Several factors play into the success of this concept. It is not possible to achieve this
        goal if the application is not properly designed. To achieve this, design principles of several disciplines are
        applied to achieve a user-centric solution.</p>

    <h2>User Experience Design</h2>
    <p>The term "user experience" was first coined by Don Norman in the early 1990s when he was working at Apple
        (NORMAN, 2013, P. XIII F.). User experience comprises all aspects of a user’s interaction with a company, its
        services, and its products. The focus and most important goal of good user experience is to meet the user’s
        needs in every aspects. Close cooperation is required between different disciplines, such as engineering,
        marketing, graphic design, industrial design, and interface design <cite>(NORMAN & NIELSEN, N.D.)</cite>.</p>

    <blockquote>
        »Good design is actually a lot harder to notice than poor design, in part because good designs fit our needs
        so well that the design is invisible, serving us without drawing attention to itself. Bad design, on the other
        hand, screams out its inadequacies, making itself very noticeable.«
        <figcaption>NORMAN, 2013, P. XI</figcaption>
    </blockquote>

    <p>User experience captures everything a user experiences while using a given product, from the visuals, the
        haptics, and the audio to how the product feels. User experience of a product comprises three primary factors:
        its look, feel, and usability <cite>(IXDF - UX DESIGN, N.D.) (→ FIG. 04).</cite></p>

    <div>
        <h3>Look</h3>

        <p>The “look” satisfies the user’s visual expectations of the product. It is about creating
            a product that is visually appealing and conveys the essence of the product
            to the user. In addition to pure aesthetics, it is also important that the content is
            communicated simply and understandably. Therefore, it is not only important
            how the product looks like but also how information is presented.</p>

        <h3>Feel</h3>

        <p>The “feel” is about creating products that are not only functional but also fun to
            use. It is important that it is a pleasant and intuitive experience when interacting
            with the product on a daily basis.</p>

        <h3>Usability</h3>

        <p>Usability is the cornerstone of user experience because if a product is difficult
            to use, the experience of using it will never be positive. Products should be designed
            to meet the needs of the user, and the product’s functions should be predictable
            for the user.</p>

    </div>

    <p>User Experience Design requires a solid understanding of the psychology and
        behavior of the user. Understanding how users perceive a product allows user
        experience designers to iterate their concepts and better achieve the user’s
        goals. According to Marc Hassenzahl and Sarah Diefenbach’s paper Well-being,
        Need Fulfillment, and Experience Design, any positive experience is based on
        meeting psychological needs. The fulfillment of psychological needs, such as
        competence, relatedness, popularity, stimulation and security, contributes to
        the well-being of the user and leads to a pleasant user experience. In experience
        design, these needs are taken as guidelines and inspiration in the design
        process <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
        Some of these needs have already been discussed in Chapter 2.1, but in the
        following, they are considered from the perspective of emotion, while additional
        needs are addressed.</p>


    <div>
        <h3>Competence</h3>

        <p>Competence is the feeling that one’s actions are perceived as capable and effective
            instead of thinking that one is incapable and incompetent <cite>(HASSENZAHL &
                DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</p>

        <h3>Relatedness</h3>

        <p>Relatedness is the feeling of having intimate and personal relationships with
            the people in the environment, rather than feeling lonely or unnoticed <cite>(HASSENZAHL
                & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</p>

        <h3>Popularity</h3>

        <p>Popularity is the feeling of being respected and influencing others, rather than
            feeling like a person whose advice and opinion are ignored <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH,
                2012, P. 1)</cite>.</p>

        <h3>Stimulation</h3>

        <p>Stimulation is the feeling of experiencing much of joy and pleasure instead of
            feeling bored and understimulated <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.</p>

        <h3>Security</h3>

        <p>Security is the feeling of having stability and control over one’s own life, rather
            than feeling uncertain and threatened by circumstances one cannot control
            <cite>(HASSENZAHL & DIEFENBACH, 2012, P. 1)</cite>.
        </p>
    </div>

    <p>As discussed in Chapter 2.1, the social aspect is an important factor in motivating
        people to participate in various activities. Thus, it is also an important
        factor for participation in sports. Since this thesis addresses the question of
        how online sports community apps should be designed to increase the user’s
        participation in team sports, the focus during the design phase is laid especially
        on relatedness.</p>

    <p>In the context of user experience design, needs are also called “user needs”.
        In addition to the approach of Hassenzahl and Diefenbach, other approaches
        define user needs for good user experience. Design leader Stephen P. Anderson,
        for example, developed the “User Experience Hierarchy of Needs” model <cite>(→ FIG.
            05)</cite>. Rather than focusing on the psychological side of the user needs, this model
        is based on a product’s maturity process. Anderson proposes that products proceed
        through six stages of maturity, during which they can grow from a purely
        functional product, to a product that is meaningful to the user <cite>(ANDERSON, 2011,
            P. 10F.)</cite>.</p>
